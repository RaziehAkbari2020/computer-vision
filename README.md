Face recognition system
Target:
Designing a face recognition system that is able to identify people's faces in images or videos.

Project stages:
Collecting data:

Using a public dataset such as Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), which contains images of different people's faces.
Data preprocessing:

Convert images to black and white to reduce complexity.
Normalizing images and resizing them to a standard size.
Deep learning model training:

Using well-known models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn facial features.
Using transfer learning techniques with pre-trained models such as VGGFace or FaceNet.
Model evaluation:

Model testing using data not used in training.
Evaluating the accuracy of diagnosis using criteria such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
Implementation:

Create a user interface for uploading images and displaying face recognition results.
The possibility of using the system in different applications.
Technologies and tools:
Programming language: Python
Libraries and frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
Preprocessing tools: scikit-image, NumPy
